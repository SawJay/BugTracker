The Bug Tracker is a software defect tracking system. It is built with ASP.NET, Blazor, C# and SQL. A role based security system was implemented to create permission based roles. The roles of Admin , Project Manager, Developer and Submitter restrict what the user can see and do. The software allows for users to submit tickets and those tickets are tracked through status from Open to Complete.
